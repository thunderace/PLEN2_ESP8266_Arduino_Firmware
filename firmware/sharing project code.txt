Visual Studio Shared C++ Projects are supported

Shared projects enabled cpp/h source code to be developed and shared between multiple projects.

During compile, shared project code is merged into the temp build folder (or sub folders) and can therefore be treated the same as if it is in an Arduino project.

Using the Solution Explorer, you must add a 'Reference' from an Arduino project to a Shared Project otherwise intellisense and build will not work correctly. 

Shared projects that also conform to the Arduino 3rd Party Library Specification will be treated as Arduino Libraries and not as Shared Project code.
